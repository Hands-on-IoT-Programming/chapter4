Code samples for Chapter 5 Data processing with NodeRED

- To evolve the `app` folder from chapter 4 you just need to install Sense Hat simulator package with npm:
```bash
$ cd ./app
$ npm install node-red-node-pi-sense-hat-simulator
```
This module is now included in `package.json` of the app.

**NOTE**: *Installation of packages from the NodeRED editor puts the new packages in the user data folder, i.e. `data`. Hence they are not added to the NodeRED package.json in the `app` folder.*
